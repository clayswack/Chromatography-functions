MATLAB Builder EX 

1. Prerequisites for Deployment 

. Verify the MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR) is installed and ensure you    
  have installed version 8.3 (R2014a).  

. If the MCR is not installed, do the following:
  (1) enter
  
      >>mcrinstaller
      
      at MATLAB prompt. The MCRINSTALLER command displays the 
      location of the MCR Installer.

  (2) run the MCR Installer.

Or download the Windows 32-bit version of the MCR for R2014a 
from the MathWorks Web site by navigating to

   http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html
   

For more information about the MCR and the MCR Installer, see 
Distribution to End Users in the MATLAB Compiler documentation  
in the MathWorks Documentation Center.

NOTE: You will need administrator rights to run MCRInstaller.

2. Files to Deploy and Package

-doge_1_0.dll (output from mcc)
-doge.bas (VBA module file created by mcc)
-doge.xla (Excel AddIn file created by mcc)
-MCRInstaller.exe
   -if end users are unable to download the MCR using the above  
    link, include it when building your component by clicking 
    the "Add MCR" link in the Deployment Tool
-This readme file

NOTE: Verify doge_1_0.dll is registered on the target machine. If you have trouble 
      registering this DLL, see Troubleshooting in the MATLAB Builder EX documentation in 
      the MathWorks Documentation Center.
